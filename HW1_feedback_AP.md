Great job on the hw overall, very on point with the questions.<br>
Just a few things to point out:<br>
Your "rank" variable, is called "prestige" in the data set. <br>
For qusetion 2a: You generally assume the data is normally distributed and then go through the exploration process to learn if otherwise. <br>
Question 3a: Outliers generally skew the associations between the variables in the direction of the outliers. <br>
