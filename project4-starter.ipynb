    "Answer: As expected we find positive coefficient on the GRE and GPA variables and negatives coefficients on the three prestige dummy variables. This is consistent with out expectation that higher GRE score and higher GPA would lead to a higher probability of admission, while lower rank (i.e. 2,3,4 with 4 being the worst) would decrease the probability of admission.\n",
    "In particular we find that a unit increase on GRE inscreases the odds of admission by a factor of 1.0022, a unit increase  in GPA - by a factor of 2.18 and having prestige 2,3,4 decrease the odds (compared to prestige=1) by the factors 0.506, 0.262, 0.211, respectively."

    "Answer: Our results are consistent with our prior expectations of the effects of GRE, GPA and prestige. The model used was the simplest logit with a linear combination of the variables. We can try to improve our analysis looking at the effect of including polynomial and interaction terms into the logistic regression. A guidance whether this might improve the results should be provided by looking at the residuals and making sure there are no discernable patterns in the residuals. Along the same lines we can try to transform our variables to reduce skew and see if it improves the logistic $R^2$.  We should also look at the effects of possible outliers and influential points by applying standard regression diagnostic methods."
