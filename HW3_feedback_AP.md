I didn't provide you feedback on HW2 because it was spot on, no real comments to share. Great job! <br>
Overall great job on HW3 too, a few bits of feeback:<br>
Q3.3: the odds ratio is simply the (odds of being admitted given prestige=1)/(odds of admittance given prestige<>1) <br>
Q3.4: For students who attended a top ranked college, the odds of being admitted into graduate school are 3.07 times the odds of students who did not attend a top tier school.<br>
Q3.5: Given the dummy variables you've created, you can just use "pd.crosstab(handCalc['admit'], handCalc['prestige_4.0'], rownames=['admit'])" to get the cross tab for prestige 4.0. <br>
Q3.6: OR = (12*216.0)/(114*55)  = 0.41 <br>
Q3.7: For students who attended a 4th tier school the odds of being admitted into gradauate school are 0.41 times the odds of students who did not attend a 4th teir school. <br>
